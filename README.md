# Countrynator

The project was carried out during the second year of studies. The aim of the project was to create the game, that is based on a series of questions, with the basic answers being yes and no (there are also "maybe", "probably yes" and "probably no"). An artificial intelligence hidden in the form of the titular genie selects questions to guess, through elimination, which country the player is thinking of.
